<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?

My interest in IT is the fact that I just love technology, whether is be setting up a computer to setting up an electronics device and everything in between. This fascination in IT started when I very young, like 8 or 9 years old, I always saw it as a hobby and something fun to do but challenging at the same time. I guess, the event that sparked by interest in IT when when I was around 10 or 11 when as in school. Myself and a couple of other kids that excelled in computer studies we assisted in creating the schools first website.

Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

I chose to study though RMIT as I felt it was going to be the best fit for me personally. From the subjects that are offered in the course and how they will help assist me later on in my professional career to the fact how engaging it is, especially when you are studying online, you don't feel like that your by yourself and have to go at it alone since you aren't able to have the "classroom experience' offered at your typical university. One of the bonuses of studying at RMIT, is that how well known it is and the chance of achieving a great position.

What do you expect to learn during your studies?

What I expect to learn throughout my degree is to be able to write in different form of code that is issued in the professional industry, assist in preparing me for what employers expectation on the required skills need to succeed within the industry, understand the different pathways there are with in the IT industry. As I want to become a programmer/developer, it is import to be able to hone your skills and perfect your craft, this degree will allow be to achieve just that but most importantly is to be excited about what you do for work and be excited/happy about going to work in the morning.

<h1>Personal Profile</<h1>
<h2>The results of an online Myers-Briggs test</h2>
<h3>https://assessment.mbtionline.com/Registration</h3>
 Results : ISFPs have a great deal of warmth but may not show it until they know a person well. They enjoy the present moment and are often relaxed and easygoing. They are loyal and committed to their values and to those important to them. They are modest about their abilities, dislike disagreements and conflict, and do not force their values or opinions on others. They value home, family, health, and financial security.
Characteristics of ISFPs • ISFPs try to take time to enjoy the people and the world around them.
• They are attuned to the sensory details in their environment.
• ISFPs find quiet satisfaction in simple pleasures.
• They learn more by doing than by reading.
• Their easygoing nature often hides their deep values and commitments. ISFPs with Others
• ISFPs care deeply about people but may show it more through acts of kindness than through words.
• They are loyal and committed to people important to them.
• They are faithful in fulfilling obligations to others.
• ISFPs are attuned to the feelings and needs of others and flexible in responding to them.
• They tend to be quiet and unassuming, and so may underrate themselves and be underestimated by others.
• Their warmth, enthusiasm, and playful humor may not be apparent to people who don’t know them well.
• They have little wish to dominate or control in interpersonal situations.
ISFPs at Work • ISFPs want to have a purpose beyond their paycheck. They want to contribute to people’s well-being or happiness and will work with energy and dedication when doing something they believe in.
• They are perfectionists when they care deeply about something, and are particularly suited for work that requires both devotion and adaptability.
• They like to have their own space and to work within their own time frame.
• They often excel in craftsmanship, and their handiwork is usually more eloquent than their words.
• Many ISFPs have a special love of nature and a sympathy with animals.
• They are apt to enjoy fields in which taste, discrimination, and a sense of beauty and proportion are important.
• They tend to gravitate toward work that allows them to contribute to human understanding, happiness, or health, such as positions in teaching and healthcare.
• They don’t like jobs that require an analytical, impersonal approach to people.
Potential Blind Spots for ISFPs
• If ISFPs have not developed their Feeling preference, they may not take the time to go inside and consider their values and therefore may make decisions they later regret.
• Or, they may avoid making decisions altogether, allowing others or circumstances to decide for them.
• If they have not developed their Sensing preference, ISFPs may have no reliable way of getting accurate data about the external world, and their decisions will then be overly personal.
• ISFPs may feel such a contrast between their ideals and their accomplishments that they burden themselves with a sense of inadequacy. This can be true even when they are being just as effective as others.
• The most modest of all the types, ISFPs tend to underrate and understate themselves and may take for granted anything they do well. They may then become overly sensitive and vulnerable, with dwindling confidence in themselves.

<h2>Big Five Personality Test</h2>
<h3>https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/</h3>
Results : Factor I was labelled as Extroversion by the developers of the IPIP-BFFM. Factor I is sometimes given other names, such as Surgency or Positive Emotionality.
Individuals who score high on Factor I one are outgoing and social. Individuals who score low tend to be shut ins.
<h2>What do the results of these tests mean?</h2>
The results to the above test show an accurate representation of my personality when it comes to both in my personal life as well as my work.
<h2>How do you think these results may influence behaviour when working in a team?</h2>
It could influence behaviours within a group as there could be too many leaders (people who always want to take control) or no no leaders at all (everyone being indecisive and not making a call).
<h2>How should this be taken into account when forming a team?</h2>
I don't believe the results to these test have any effect on when forming groups as everyone is aiming towards a common goal of achieve the best possible result or mark. The actions of one person, has a flow on effect to the rest of the group.
<h1>Project Idea: Cleaning robot</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This project will be based around the creation of a cleaning robot. The sections that will covered in this project is motivation around the project idea (why is the product needed), detailed description of the robot (i.e. the function and use), the tools & technology need to produce the robot, the necessary skills needed for the project (i.e. software, hardware, skilled professionals needs for the manufacture of the robot & feasibility of the product itself) and most importantly is the overall outcome (whether it will be successful or not & does it actually solve a problem faced in today’s society.
<h2>Motivation</h2>
The motivation behind this project idea of a cleaning robot is the fact there is so much emphasis on having a clean house, which everyone wants but people don’t have the time, can’t be bothered and medically unable to do it themselves and hire someone else to do it for them. A study taken in the US from 2013, shows that a whopping 900,000 people are hired as a maid/cleaner where the worldwide total being 52,000,000 (House Cleaning By the Numbers - https://infographicjournal.com/house-cleaning-by-the-numbers/ ). That’s why the creation of a robotic housekeeper is a must and a genuine necessity.
<h2>Description</h2>
Listed below are the detailed description of the cleaning robots’ functions in general & how they will can be customised based on the conditions that it will be faced with and that the robot is customised to that specific industry, examples if how it will be used within a few specific industries (hospitals, building sites, labs, restaurants and office buildings) compared to the general at home use for various individuals and the overall safety benefits in using the product.
The major function with the robot is the it can be customised based on the conditions that it will be faced with (i.e. extreme weather conditions) such as still being able to complete tasks during torrential rain or when it is 45°C plus, conditions that are generally not suited to the normal person would definitely be difficult to complete. the term I have created to explain this is ‘industry specific customization of the product’, this will be very important to make this robot attractive to multiple channels and will be explained in the next section.
The various industry professionals that will be initially targeted are as follows:
Hospitals and labs as there are such a massive emphasis on cleanliness and removing any chance of bacteria and germs spreading to multiple sections. As robots don’t carry diseases around with them, this would be the most ideal location for a cleaning robot would be located.
Building site and office buildings will also benefit from the assistance of having a cleaning robot on site as it can be programmed to sense when there is a hazard of any kind around and be dealt with straight away before it become a larger issue down the track as well as being able to assist or even lift heavy objects where machinery would normally be needed.
Restaurants are one place that that a cleaning robot would be needed as kitchens need to be kept clean and sterilised as much as possible to removed the chances of cross contamination between the sections and removes the chances the someone touching garbage then returning to preparing food.
Lastly there is the cleaning robot’s use in the domestic market, for the individuals that don’t have to time, can’t be bothered and medically unable to clean their houses themselves. This market, as stated previously, will be an excellent area to have cleaning robot deployed in. Being able to seize the day and not have to worry about all the housework that needs to be done once they are home or for people that physically can’t that clean themselves due to illnesses.
Safety is the mostly underlying purpose of having a cleaning robot in the above mentioned avenues in bout the professional and domestic capacities. Some of these are; minimising accidents due to human error such as leaving debris and spillages around in offices and job sites, removing potentially hazardous conditions such as chemicals left out in the open in lab and hospitals or spillages left on floors in restaurant kitchens.
<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
The following tools needs for the construction of the cleaning robot as mechanical/hardware tools such as hammer, screwdrivers & wrenches soldering iron (just to name a few), numerous amounts of cabling, a breadboard (circuit board to connect all the components together), customised software for the robot & a hard drive to store it and metal for the interior and exterior of the robot. The open source tools that can be used to assist in the manufacturing of the robots are Selenium, Katalon Studio, Unified Functional Testing, TestCompete and Watir, each having their own specific use in the programming stage.
<h2>Skills Required</h2>
The skills needed to manufacture the cleaning robot are; systems thinking (understanding how the different systems work together), programming mindset (being able to write the appropriate algorithm to run the actual program), active learning (being able to continually learn), mathematics (will need have a great understanding of algebra, calculus and geometry), science (being able to take theories and produce results), communication (needs to be able to work in a team environment) & complex problem solving (being able to foresee an issue and fix prior to it occurring). All of the listed skills are very feasible in finding the right people.
<h2>Outcome</h2>
The outcome of this project will show the consumer, whether it be an industry profession or sed for a domestic purpose, people will see that the absolute need and/or desire for it. This project addresses the original problem of the hassles and hazards faced when needing to keep places clean & tidy and not needing to constantly check it the take is getting done. Impact this development will have on the have on society, as a whole, will be no longer need to actively look for cleaning companies when they have a pre-programmed robot to ensure the job is done.
